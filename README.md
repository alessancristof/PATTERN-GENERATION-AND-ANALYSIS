Project: PATTERN GENERATION AND ANALYSIS
Matlab functions used in "Robust collagen texture quantification in nonlinear microscopy by combining the gradient structure tensor with a mixed noise model", Cristoforetti et al, IEEE Transaction on Medical Imaging.
The code is feely avalable for use and modification, provided that the article is credited.
An outline for code use is in "Intructions for code.docx".
